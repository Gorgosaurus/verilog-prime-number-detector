Highest-level Verilog module (MainCircuitPrimeNumberProject.v) contains all required Verilog modules in it. It contains 1 Hz clock divider, 1 kHz clock divider, 10 kHz clock divider, square root calculator, prime number detector, counter, binary to BCD converter and cathode-anode Verilog modules. TestNumber (input number) is hardcoded in the highest-level Verilog module. Project must be compiled for testing different values of TestNumber. Highest-level Verilog module contains required interim signals for enabling and disabling respective Verilog modules. These interim signals will be explained. Once square root calculation is done, square root calculator will produce enable signal (EnablePrimeNumberDetection) and square root of TestNumber for prime number detector Verilog module. Once calculations in prime number detector are done, prime number detector will produce disable (StopCounter) signal for counter and counter will not count any more.
